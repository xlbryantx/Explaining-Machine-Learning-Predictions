<!-- 1. Build inherently interpretable predictive models (e.g. Linear models, Decision Trees)

It certain settins, accuracy-interpretability trade offs may exist.
 
2. Explain pre-built models in a post-hoc manner (e.g. LIME, Teacher-student)


If you can build an interpretable model which is also adequately accurate for your setting, DI IT!


Otherwise, post hoc explanations come to the rescure!


What is an Explanation?

Defination: Interpretable description of the model behavior
Faithful: 
 :

Global explanation may be too complicated 
Defination: Interpretable description of the model behavior in a target neighborhood


Local Explanations vs. Global explanations
1. Explain individual predictions                                                 vs      explain complete behavior of the model 
2. Help unearth biases in the local neighborhood of a given instance              vs      Help shed light on big picture biases affeting larger subgroups
3. Help vet if individual predictions are being made for the right reasons        vs      Help vet if the model, at a high level, is suitable for deployment.
